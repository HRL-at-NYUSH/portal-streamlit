        "description": "With the exception of the 1970-1990 Puerto Rican censuses, RACE was asked of every person in all years. The concept of race has changed over the more than 150 years represented in the IPUMS. Currently, the Census Bureau and others consider race to be a sociopolitical construct, not a scientific or anthropological one. Many detailed RACE categories consist of national origin groups. Beginning in 2000, the race question changed substantially to allow respondents to report as many races as they felt necessary to describe themselves. In earlier years, only one race response was coded. IPUMS offers several variables describing the answer(s) to the race question. RACE provides the full detail given by the respondent and/or released by the Census Bureau; it is not always historically compatible (see comparability discussion below). Users primarily interested in historical compatibility should consider using RACESING, and should consult the race code relationship page, Relationship between RACE and RACESING codes, for detail about how the RACE and RACESING codes are related. In addition, specific combinations of major races can be discerned using the following bivariate indicators of whether a particular race group was reported: RACAMIND, RACASIAN, RACBLK, RACOTHER, RACPACIS, and RACWHT. RACNUM indicates the total number of major race groups reported for an individual. The information contained in the bivariate indicators and in RACNUM is integrated into the detailed version of RACE. Users primarily interested in historical comparability should consider using RACESING and/or the accompanying variables PROBAI, PROBAPI, PROBBLK, PROBOTH, and PROBWHT. Note that Hispanic origin is assessed through separate questioning (see HISPAN). Prior to 1960, the census enumerator was responsible for categorizing persons and was not specifically instructed to ask the individual his or her race. In 1970 and later years, an individual's race was reported by someone in the household or group quarters. In the 1990 U.S. census, the 2000 U.S. and Puerto Rican censuses, the ACS, and the PRCS respondents were specifically asked what race the person \"considers himself/herself\" to be, although such self-description was more or less operative since 1960. User Note: Race questions were not asked in the Puerto Rican censuses of 1970, 1980, and 1990. They were asked in the 1910 and 1920 Puerto Rican censuses, the 2000-2010 Puerto Rican censuses, and the PRCS.",

This variable relies on the modified version of the 1950 occupational classification scheme available in the OCC1950 variable. EDSCOR50 is derived by using educational attainment information (available in EDUC) for the employed civilian labor force aged 16 and up, excluding persons who did not work in the past year. For years prior to 1950, occupations are assigned the EDSCOR50 value derived from the 1950 data. The OCC1950 categories 12-29 (professors and instructors) were treated as one single category in the process of deriving EDSCOR50, since there were not enough cases to be kept as separate categories. All these occupational categories have the same value of EDSCOR50. Alternative measures of occupational standing measures that are based on OCC1950 are available in ERSCOR50, NPBOSS50, OCCSCORE, PRESGL, and SEI. For information on the construction of OCC1950 and occupational standing measures, see \"Integrated Occupation and Industry Codes and Occupational Standing Variables in the IPUMS.\" User Note: There is significant debate about the usefulness of composite measures of occupational standing (in the IPUMS, these variables include SEI, HWSEI, NPBOSS50, and NPBOSS90). We strongly urge researchers to read our user note on this issue and to familiarize themselves with the debates surrounding the use of these variables.",

The construction of this variable is described in \"Integrated Occupation and Industry Codes and Occupational Standing Variables in the IPUMS\" which users should read before using this variable. OCCSCORE assigns each occupation in all years a value representing the median total income (in hundreds of 1950 dollars) of all persons with that particular occupation in 1950. OCCSCORE thus provides a continuous measure of occupations, according to the economic rewards enjoyed by people working at them in 1950. The OCCSCORE variable is based on OCC1950. Alternative measures of occupational standing measures that are based on OCC1950 are available in EDSCOR50, ERSCOR50, NPBOSS50, PRESGL, and SEI. For information on the construction of OCC1950 and occupational standing measures, see \" Integrated Occupation and Industry Codes and Occupational Standing Variables in the IPUMS\". User caution: There is significant debate about the usefulness of composite measures of occupational standing (in the IPUMS, these variables include SEI, HWSEI, NPBOSS50, and NPBOSS90). We strongly urge researchers to read our user note on this issue and to familiarize themselves with the debates surrounding the use of these variables.",
